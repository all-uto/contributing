## üé® Style Guidelines

### Markdown Documentation

**Formatting:**
```markdown
# H1 for main title (one per document)
## H2 for major sections
### H3 for subsections

- Use `-` for unordered lists
1. Use numbers for ordered lists

**Bold** for emphasis
*Italic* for light emphasis
`Code` for inline code

\```language
Code blocks with language specified
\```

[Links](url) with descriptive text
![Images](url) with alt text
```

**Zettelkasten Linking:**
```markdown
**Upstream:**
- `[[parent-concept]]`

**Related:**
- `[[related-concept-1]]`
- `[[related-concept-2]]`

**Downstream:**
- `[[child-concept]]`
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use sentence case for headers
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- One sentence per line (for easier diffs)
- Use relative links when possible
- Include table of contents for long docs

### Code Style

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
```javascript
// Use descriptive variable names
const userProfile = getUserProfile(userId);

// Functions do one thing well
function calculateTotalPrice(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}

// Comment complex logic
// Calculate phi-based interval using Golden Ratio
const interval = baseTime * ((1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2);
```

**Python:**
```python
# Follow PEP 8
# Use descriptive names
def calculate_drift_velocity(current_drift, previous_drift, time_delta):
    """Calculate rate of ontological drift.
    
    Args:
        current_drift: Current drift measurement
        previous_drift: Previous drift measurement
        time_delta: Time elapsed between measurements
        
    Returns:
        Drift velocity in units per second
    """
    return (current_drift - previous_drift) / time_delta
```

**General Principles:**
- Clarity over cleverness
- Self-documenting code
- Comments explain "why" not "what"
- Consistent formatting
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### Naming Conventions

**Files:**
- `kebab-case-for-files.md`
- `PascalCaseForComponents.jsx`
- `snake_case_for_python.py`

**Branches:**
- `feature/add-new-capability`
- `fix/resolve-bug-description`
- `docs/improve-documentation`

**Variables:**
- `camelCase` for JavaScript
- `snake_case` for Python
- `UPPERCASE_FOR_CONSTANTS`
